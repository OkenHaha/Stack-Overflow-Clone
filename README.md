# Stack Overflow Clone Using MERN stack
Built a Stack-OverFlow-Clone using MERN stack and Redux as part of my training at NullClass as a full stack web developer Internship for a duration of 3 months.
Here are some key points about this project:
- Made an api endpoint using Redux
- User can login, singup, ask questions, comment, upvote, downvote, edit profile and logout
- Added a ChatBot with OTP integration using Twillio and React-ChatBot
### Things to work on
[ ] Fix the design
[ ] There's no feedback of wrong username or email
[ ] Add Email OTP verification when user signups. Login is also possible
[ ] User should be able to see their own password (toggle option)
[ ] Fix the ChatBot
[ ] Add Account recovery option. (Password Reset)

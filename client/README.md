# StackOverflow Clone
This is a clone version of StackOverflow using MERN stack.
This project was done during my internship period at NullClass.
There's still some errors and bugs that need work on due to new updates and changes made. 
I was given a task to implement 
1. A ChatBot with OTP verification
2. Subscription Based Plan
3. A community social platform

I was given a period of 1 days to accomplish these assignments, however, I only required one task to be completed to complete my internship. I wasn' table to complete all of these within the 1 day span, so I had not recieved my stipend but I got my internship certificate fo rsuccessfully completing the internship.
